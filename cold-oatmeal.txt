Step 1. Assemble these ingredients & supplies:

old fashioned rolled oats (not instant, quick, or steel-cut)
Greek yogurt (regular yogurt is thinner; if you use it,
you'll need to reduce the amount of milk); read my post for easy instructions
for straining regular yogurt to make Greek yogurt.
milk (I used skim, but any kind will work)
chia seeds; I bought mine at Whole Foods; also available on Amazon
half pint (1 cup) mason jars, find them at Walmart and grocery stores;
also available on Amazon

Step 2. Add oats, milk, yogurt, and chia seeds to jar, along with desired
sweeteners or flavors

Step 3. Put a lid on the jar and shake to combine. I use white plastic jar lids
sized to fit canning jars--they last longer than the metal tops and rims that
come with the jars, and they are easier to screw on and off;
some Walmarts carry them, and they're available on Amazon.

Step 4. Add fruit and stir gently until combined.

Step 5. Place in fridge overnight and up to 2 days; maybe longer depending on
the type and ripeness of the fruit. The non-banana varieties have been good
after 4 days for me.
