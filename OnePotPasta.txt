One Pot Pasta
From: http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2013/12/try-this-one-pot-pasta.html

16 oz. (one package) dry linguine
14 oz. (one can) diced tomatoes with juices
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 big sprigs of basil (plus a few more leaves for garnish)
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon chopped chives
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups vegetable stock
2 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
salt + pepper

In a large pot combine the first ten ingredients listed above. Bring the liquid to a roaring boil. Slightly reduce the heat (to a low boil) and cook for nine minutes until the pasta is al dente. Be sure to stir the pasta every once in a while so none of it sticks to the bottom of the pot. I like to check the pasta but removing a piece and taking a bite (don't burn yourself!). If it's almost cooked all the way through then you're done. :)
